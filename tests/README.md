# UNIT TEST

All tests are courtesy of Holberton school, and are not my own.

Scripts are written in `bash`. `tRash` should be built and copied into every directory
before running test scripts.

#### Usage

```shell
./checker.bash --valgrind --ltrace ./your_shell_name ./test_file
```

_NB_: Prints "OK" if successful. Prints difference or memory error if any.
