 Line 32 in _getline file, we could return -1 since it'll mean _getline failed.

 In the case of an error in _getline, we may also want to set *line_buff to NULL.
 That way we check if it is NULL in main() and then continue.
 There will be no need to free anything in main().

 characters in the string passed to our function, in case we need it for other
 vars in the future. _getenv looks great!
