 Line 32 in _getline file, we could return -1 since it'll mean _getline failed.
 We wouldnt want to exit our program.

 If _realloc fails, we would want to free the original malloced memory before returning -1.

 In the case of an error in _getline, we may also want to set *line_buff to NULL.
 That way we check if it is NULL in main() and then continue.
 There will be no need to free anything in main().

 From Chee: For the first loop in _getenv, we may want to check against all
 characters in the string passed to our function, in case we need it for other
 vars in the future. _getenv looks great!
