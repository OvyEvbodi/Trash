 Line 32 in _getline file, we could return -1 since it'll mean _getline failed.
 We wouldnt want to exit our program.
Fri Nov  4 13:14:44 2022
 If _realloc fails, we would want to free the original malloced memory before returning -1.

Fri Nov  4 13:24:10 2022
 In the case of an error in _getline, we may also want to set *line_buff to NULL.
 That way we check if it is NULL in main() and then continue.
 There will be no need to free anything in main().

 From Chee: For the first loop in _getenv, we may want to check against all
 characters in the string passed to our function, in case we need it for other
 vars in the future. _getenv looks great!

 From Ovy: I altered line 291 in the main function.

Tue Nov  8 00:52:53 2022
 From Ovy: cd  should update the pwd of its current process, not the parent process, so I think we're good on that one.

Tue Nov  8 00:53:52 2022
 From Ovy: I can't seem to figure out how to check the updated environment after calling setenv

Tue Nov  8 00:54:57 2022
 From Ovy: Kindly run valgrind on the updated version of our program.

Tue Nov  8 01:01:05 2022
 From Ovy: More than 5 functions in tRash.c.

 From Ovy: I'm currently working on the echo variable replacements. The idea is to concatenate 3 strings, the first part being composed of the characters(if they exist) that precede the $$/$? triggers, the second being the replaced values of those triggers, and the third, the succeeding characters. I was hoping to use a counter variable to keep track of the first part so as to be able to backtrack the traversing process efficiently, but there seems to be a problem with my approach. Itâ€™s a messy code, and I only pushed it to keep you up to speed with my activities.

 From Chee: Ovy, some things to note while working on the exit built-in.
 Exit only evaluates its first argument.
 The argument must only contain digits.
 The number can't be longer than 9 characters.
 The number can only be positive.
 The exit status is always the number mod 256.

Thu Nov 10 08:42:36 2022
 From chee: ovy, when exit code too long or too high, display an error message and do not exit.

Thu Nov 10 08:43:29 2022
 From chee: chee, find way to get exit correct exit status of previous process for 'echo $?'

Thu Nov 10 08:44:21 2022
 From chee: chee, find way to take out the full path of commands before they can display their error message.

Thu Nov 10 09:16:13 2022
 From chee: The current version of echo now supports all the relevant escape characters. It also acts exactly like the echo in sh. 

Thu Nov 10 17:02:20 2022
 From Chee: to superstar, I have written all the functions (I think) that can will do all the operations our env linked list requires.
 I have incorporated the linked list into the program. 08:42 message still valid.
Thu Nov 10 17:05:56 2022
 From Chee: to superstar, I have added the env built-in which will print from our linked list instead of the executable.

Thu Nov 10 17:30:18 2022
 From chee: to super, if you get around to working on set and unset env, there's a test_env.c you can use to see how the function you can use work.

Thu Nov 10 21:22:49 2022
 From chee: to super, I have worked on setenv and unsetenv, ignore previous note.
