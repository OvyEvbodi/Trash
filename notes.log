 Line 32 in _getline file, we could return -1 since it'll mean _getline failed.
 We wouldnt want to exit our program.

 If _realloc fails, we would want to free the original malloced memory before returning -1.

 In the case of an error in _getline, we may also want to set *line_buff to NULL.
 That way we check if it is NULL in main() and then continue.
 There will be no need to free anything in main().

 From Chee: For the first loop in _getenv, we may want to check against all
 characters in the string passed to our function, in case we need it for other
 vars in the future. _getenv looks great!

 From Ovy: I altered line 291 in the main function.

 From Ovy: cd  should update the pwd of its current process, not the parent process, so I think we're good on that one.

 From Ovy: I can't seem to figure out how to check the updated environment after calling setenv

 From Ovy: Kindly run valgrind on the updated version of our program.

 From Ovy: More than 5 functions in tRash.c.

 From Ovy: I'm currently working on the echo variable replacements. The idea is to concatenate 3 strings, the first part being composed of the characters(if they exist) that precede the $$/$? triggers, the second being the replaced values of those triggers, and the third, the succeeding characters. I was hoping to use a counter variable to keep track of the first part so as to be able to backtrack the traversing process efficiently, but there seems to be a problem with my approach. Itâ€™s a messy code, and I only pushed it to keep you up to speed with my activities.

 From Chee: Ovy, some things to note while working on the exit built-in.
 Exit only evaluates its first argument.
 The argument must only contain digits.
 The number can't be longer than 9 characters.
 The number can only be positive.
 The exit status is always the number mod 256.
